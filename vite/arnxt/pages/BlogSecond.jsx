              Augmented Reality Augmented reality in our surroundings. To have a
              better understanding of this technology we need to know about
              Immersive Technology. What is immersive technology? This might be
              the query that strikes you now. Immersive Technology is the
              technology where a user is taken into the virtual world or
              computer world. The immersive world is divided into three kinds,
              they are V.R(virtual reality), A.R(augmented reality), M.R(mixed
              reality). Past Virtual Reality, firstly the meaning of the word
              “virtual” is not real or not fact. So the name itself tells us
              that it’s an unreal thing. V.R takes to the virtual world by
              creating computer-generated graphics. It’s completely a computer
              world. Where every single object is made by the processor with
              great details. The roots of this technology were from the machine
              invented by Morton Heiling in the 1950s. His machine Sensorama is
              embedded with multiple senses like sight, sound, smell, and touch.
              Virtual reality allows the user an immersive experience where one
              can go round the world from the place he’s sitting. It’s a
              revolutionary technology used in many sectors for many uses.
              Present Augmented Reality is similar to virtual reality but again
              there exist many differences between these two. Virtual reality is
              a computer world. We get immersed in the computer-generated world.
              While Augmented reality is a combination of both the virtual and
              real world. Here real objects are combined with virtual objects.
              We can find virtual objects in our real world. So, Augmented
              reality connects the virtual and real world. This technology works
              similarly to the human brain. It creates 3D maps on real-world
              surfaces and objects similar to human senses. And then creates
              virtual objects accordingly on the surface or beside the
              real-world objects. It uses cameras to perceive objects and
              surfaces similar to human eyes. It was invented in the 90s by U.S
              . Air Force for immersive training of pilots. Later it is being
              used for various purposes and the virtual experience is better
              than virtual reality since there is a connection with the natural
              objects. It is being used in many segments in our day-to-day life
              and various departments like education, medical and defense
              systems. few examples: Google maps use augmented reality to
              overlay virtual routes on the real road for navigation. During
              football, cricket matches, A.R is used to illustrate the pitch and
              player hits and directions. IKEA app uses this technology to find
              the perfect furniture for our place. Games like Pokemon go use
              this technology. Social media also uses A.R, Snapchat filters use
              this technology. In Archaeological department, for virtual
              construction of ruined structures. Future Mixed reality is a step
              forward to Augmented reality, hence also termed as A.R 2.0. Intel
              explains that it “provides the ability to have one foot (or hand)
              in the real world, and the other in an imaginary place.” regarding
              the M.R technology. This technology is in the initial stage of its
              development. Hand-stitched by Jayanth Roy

              Opportunities for AR in Retail Market
            </h3>
          </div>

          <div className="description">
            <p className="">
              Retailers are instead turning to AR to help customers digitally
              test out thousands of beauty products to assist in buying
              decisions. <br />
              Launched six years ago, Ulta’s virtual try-on beauty tool,
              GLAMlab, has seen a surge in usage since the pandemic. Engagement
              has increased seven-fold, and more than 50 million shades of
              foundation have been swatched digitally with the app post-Covid.
              According to a Neilsen global survey from 2019, consumers listed
              Augmented and Virtual Reality as the top technologies they’re
              seeking to assist them in their daily lives. In fact, just over
              half (51%) said they were willing to use this technology to assess
              products. Thus, Totally expecting that the interest has since
              soared as we’ve seen AR shift from being sometimes gimmicky to now
              solving real pain points for customers, especially amid the
              pandemic. In fact, e-commerce company ‘Shopify’ recently released
              new data that interactions with products having AR content showed
              a 94% higher conversion rate than products without AR. Retailers
              are also beginning to use AR technology to reimagine the digital
              shopping experience with virtual storefronts. In May, retailer
              Kohl’s collaborated with Snapchat to create Kohl’s AR Virtual
              Closet. Using a smartphone and the Snapchat app, consumers can
              step inside an AR dressing room, mix and match items, and make a
              purchase without ever leaving their home.
              <br />
              The next phase of augmented retail will likely be a gamified
              social experience.Alsol ‘Burberry’ partnered with Snapchat on an
              in-store AR game, and I can see the concept being extended to
              digital storefronts and virtual closets where you can play,
              explore, and shop with friends. This coincides with a current
              trend popular among fashion and beauty brands such as Estée
              Lauder, Gucci, and Miu Miu: mobile arcade games. Burberry’s “B
              Surf'' mobile racing game even featured AR face filters and
              characters as prizes.
              <br /> <br />
              Fashion and beauty companies applying this digital entertainment
              approach are benefitting by connecting with new, younger
              consumers. Which leads us to another emerging area in augmented
              retail and digital shopping: virtual goods as commodities. We’re
              already seeing the sale of virtual merchandise from luxury
              retailers like Louis Vuitton offering digital skins (branded
              clothing and accessories to dress characters with) in the esports
              game League of Legends. Consumer spending on gaming loot boxes and
              skins worldwide is predicted to hit $50 billion (USD) by 2022.
              Virtual try-on experiences are an excellent use case for AR in
              retail: allowing consumers to preview products to scale digitally
              in their own homes, on their own bodies, and then instantly
              purchasing the corresponding physical product. But what if in
              addition to physical items, you could buy virtual objects, such as
              jewelry, apparel, or art, for which there may or may not be a
              physical counterpart? Predicting a rise in the sale of virtual
              goods with a new type of augmented retail. Impacted by the
              pandemic, the “digital lipstick effect” is a trend. The “lipstick
              effect” has historically referred to consumers continuing to spend
              on small luxury items. Lipstick as a potentially accessible
              product becomes a metaphor in today’s times, analogous to digital
              lipstick, or any virtual good. Physical retail must evolve in
              response, and AR has proven that it can add enormous value for
              consumers in the shopping journey. Now is the time for business
              leaders and brands to not only reimagine retail, but to catapult
              these immersive shopping experiences into the future.

                Difficulties: Lack of Proven Business Models
              </h3>
              One of the weirdest things about Augmented Reality technology is
              that despite experiencing broad adoption and mass public
              acceptance - it is not doing all that well business-wise. Let's
              dive deep into the reason for the lack of industry growth in the
              field. There is a steady flow of investments in the augmented
              reality app market, and the general background is more than
              positive. However, all these investments are yet to pay off big
              time. Part of the reason is that no one has figured out a distinct
              AR-related Business Model that will work long-term; besides,
              probably, the gaming industry. Sure, startups are popping up with
              more and more outlandish concepts at hand and many big companies
              are trying out various AR-related solutions, but there is one
              thing that should be noted - all these solutions are integrated
              into the business models that can be effective with or without an
              AR solution.
              <br /> <br />
              The biggest AR product of recent times - Pokemon Go broke even
              only because of the power of the brand. After the hype died down,
              the retention rate followed. The same goes for IKEA and Amazon AR
              applications - they are fun, but you can live without them.
              However, there is a ray of light in the form of industrial
              companies. Why? They have enough financial resources to boost
              development, and there are plenty of fields where AR technology
              might come at handy. Let’s name a few: Proof of Concept for
              construction projects; Discrepancy Checking; Construction Progress
              Monitoring; Hidden infrastructure visualization; Maintenance
              Instructions; These kinds of applications have the potential to
              establish an augmented reality technology not as a toy but as a
              viable helping tool that improves the overall quality of the end
              product One of the best hardware startup examples of this
              situation where the challenge was successfully navigated is
              Fitbit. Though there have been many IoT sensor products designed
              for different applications including fitness, Fitbit managed to
              not only innovate on the product offering but it also found a
              sustainable business model to scale revenue, helping them cross
              the chasm of innovation to reach mainstream customers. But why is
              creating a great business model so difficult? Why don’t more
              startups start first with the perfect business model and then seek
              technology innovation? And why is it often the second or third
              waves of startups which have a higher success rate than previous
              ones? All of these questions are valid and require a deep dive
              into the obstacles associated with being a pioneer leading a new
              industry. In particular at my startup, we have learned a lot in
              our journey and still have not crossed the chasm. Yet I would like
              to share some of the lessons that have come with being early in
              VR, AR and AI with both hardware and software.
              <br /> <br />
              <h3 className="text-center">
                Lack of Augmented Reality App Design & Development Standards
              </h3>
              tandards are something of a universal language for a software
              application. It is one of the ways to secure its compatibility and
              contribution to the overall development of the technology. At the
              moment, this is the thing that is under construction for Augmented
              Reality. The reason is simple - it's too soon. The technology is
              too new, and it is still coming to its own both in hardware and
              software terms (despite "technically" being around for a while.)
              So what’s the problem? Without standards, every augmented
              reality-related project is a thing of its own barely compatible
              with the others. That complicates the process of unifying
              solutions to the greater whole which makes the overall development
              of the technology much slower than it could have been if everyone
              had been on the same page. However, implementation of technical
              standards is a question of time, and its adoption will signify the
              final stage of establishing the technology as a real deal.

              <h3 className="text-center">
                Security & Privacy Issues with Augmented Reality
              </h3>
              Privacy & Security also pose significant challenges for the AR
              industry. Due to inconsistencies in augmented reality programming,
              oversight, and negligence, there is a legitimate chance of getting
              into trouble without meaning to do so. The biggest issue is that
              no actual regulation designates what is allowed and what is not in
              the augmented reality environment. This means the technology can
              be used with malicious intent just as it can be used for
              entertainment. For example, the “try before you buy” option for
              clothing, but instead of overlaying the cloth on your body someone
              may overlay another nude body and spread it to damage your
              reputation or blackmail. Or AR can be used to hijack accounts via
              surveillance and mining data output by slightly manipulating and
              overlaying AR content (just as in ad stacking fraud schemes). Part
              of the problem is a lack of awareness about these problems. People
              don’t understand how sensitive the subject is. The other part of
              the problem is the reluctance of the developers to take action
              before there is any heat on the corner.
              <h3 className="text-center">The Possibility of Physical Harm</h3>
              While long-term effects of using Augmented reality are much better
              documented than ones for Virtual Reality (uh-hm), there is still a
              significant possibility of harming yourself and the surroundings
              due to the nature of the application and lack of attention. The
              thing is - Augmented Reality operates in the real world and adds a
              little bit of digital into it. These elements are driving
              attention away from reality which may cause a potentially
              dangerous situation. For example, remember all the news about
              people hurting themselves while playing Pokemon Go? Well, it is
              just the tip of an iceberg. Augmented Reality, while being a
              worthwhile addition to the proceedings, can also serve as a
              significant distracting factor. This is why automobile
              manufacturers are so reluctant with implementing AR displays - it
              is more of a liability than the actual advantage for the driving
              process. As such, there is a need to develop a certain kind of AR
              interface that will be useful and yet not distracting from the
              process.
              <br />

              <h3 className="text-center">
                Poor Quality of Content & Use Cases
              </h3>
              While AR technology is rapidly developing and gradually expanding
              its scope - the problem with its use cases and the content
              remains. It is currently leading the top of unsolved problems in
              augmented reality in terms of being threatening to derail an
              industry. The majority of AR-related content available at App
              Stores is mostly a showcase of simple tricks and not much else.
              Its goal is to present some brands as forward-looking and cunning.
              It is designed to be a one-off affair. Sure, AR technology is
              still in its infancy, but if you look at what augmented reality
              development companies are trying to pull off with more or less the
              same tools (all HoloLens or Google Cardboard projects related to
              Healthcare or Education) - the solutions above seem a bit lacking.
              Part of the reason for this problem is because of a lack of
              expertise in the field. There are not enough developers who have a
              firm grasp on technology and can deliver an accessible and useful
              experience. The other big problem looming over the AR industry is
              the lack of credible use cases for AR technology. At the moment,
              the majority of AR apps are one-trick ponies that can do one thing
              which can be done without their assistance with the same level of
              effectiveness. Augmented Reality is an additional element to other
              activities by design - it must significantly contribute to the
              process either by providing additional information more
              conveniently or providing assistance in performing specific
              actions. Part of the reason why it is so is that of the very
              nature of AR - it is an addition, augmentation of the other thing,
              and the only way for it to be successful is to be a natural
              extension that makes the overall activity easier and more
              effective, which comes with tries and fails. AR displays for cars
              seems like a good idea on paper, but not a useful solution in
              practice. On the other hand, AR in medical or engineering training
              can be very helpful. The same goes for infrastructure planning and
              on-set simulations.

                Social Issues of Augmented Reality: Public Acceptance &
                Retention
              </h3>
              While Augmented Reality seems to be a relatively popular topic in
              the media and frequently mentioned as one of the most exciting
              emerging technologies - its overall public reception is, for the
              lack of a better word, mild. Part of the reason for that is that
              the quality of the majority of AR content is mostly hit and miss.
              Out of this comes the notion that AR applications are nothing more
              than an unnecessary addition. However, the situation will probably
              revert with a couple of “killer apps” that will prove the worth of
              technology in one swift sweep. The other part of the problem is
              that the public, for the most part, is not aware of the benefits
              of augmented reality in various fields. It is still perceived as
              zany science fiction by a significant portion of potential users.
              Then there is a retention problem. Despite the popularity of
              Augmented Reality technology steadily growing over the past few
              years, there is still a significant problem in keeping an audience
              using Augmented Reality applications in a long-term perspective.
              The current state of affairs with AR apps looks like this: users
              download the app because they saw an advert that excited them a
              couple of times until the goal is realized or interest is
              satisfied and then abandon the app due to lack of long-term use
              cases.

                Augmented Reality Technology Problems & Limitations
              </h3>
              Another big problem with implementing AR solutions is the
              technological gap between AR devices. It is one thing to design an
              app for a fully-fledged AR gear, and it is a completely different
              thing to do it for a smartphone. The latter case got many
              limitations that make the whole experience not really
              user-friendly and somewhat redundant to the activity it augments.
              Considering that the majority of the target audience will not
              likely purchase AR gear due to its impractical and high prices -
              smartphones remain a preferred function and since they have
              certain augmented reality app design limitations - it neuters the
              whole point of implementing AR solution to the mix. What’s the
              solution to this problem? It is a question of time when the price
              for AR gear will drop to a mass consumer acceptable level. The
              thing is - Augmented Reality Technology is in its early stages,
              and it is too soon to expect that its gear will be available for a
              regular Joe from the get-go.

              <h3 className="text-center">
                Ethical and Legal Issues with Augmented Reality
              </h3>
              The main ethical challenges in terms of AR implementation include
              facial recognition and anonymity, mental and social side effects,
              unrealistic expectations, reality distortion, and manipulation.
              These ethical considerations need to be taken into account in
              terms of AR. Currently, there is no regulatory infrastructure in
              place to moderate the development and deployment of AR technology.
              What is even more worrying is that the speed at which technology
              is advancing is too fast for the traditional legislative system to
              account for. Blockchain technology is an example of this. As soon
              as a bill is passed new features have been added and created
              rendering the bill more or less obsolete. The control over AR
              software should be in the hands of customers so they can make the
              decisions with regard to what they want to see and what data is
              made accessible. Like all technology, AR is a two-edged sword and
              needs to be correctly wielded in order to be effective. With high
              power comes great responsibility and AR is such a power. While it
              is fantastic that you can easily navigate through the streets
              using your augmented reality app, public spaces become a sort of
              "hijacked." Remembering the Pokemon Go and the rather sensitive
              story about how people go to the Holocaust Museum to catch "that
              one pokemon" they need for the collection? It is also important to
              remember that when people are using augmented reality apps, they
              are sort of "located" in two worlds - one real and another
              virtual. Therefore, as we mentioned above, you should beware of
              where you're located in the physical world, making sure you're not
              about to cross a busy road with your nose in the cell phone or
              wander into someone's private land ; and get a fine, in the
              best-case scenario.

              What Is Virtual Reality (VR)? Virtual Reality, or VR, is a
              simulated and immersive trip projected by using a gadget into the
              user’s sight. Imagine strolling down the Champs-Elisée (Paris),
              whilst nonetheless sitting in your basement in San Francisco. All
              you want is a headset projecting you into a simulation by a
              viewfinder. That’s precisely what VR promises, and a whole lot
              more. How Does VR work? Some of you may also be aware what an
              interesting trip it used to be the use of Mattel’s View-Master,
              which used to be added in the 1960s. Today’s VR is the modern-day
              model of that stereoscopic sightseeing effect: It requires a set
              of lenses interior a viewport on a headset and a hooked-up gadget
              the place the journey is saved or computed. From pure statement to
              entire immersion, the range of VR abilities varies relying on the
              gadget and kind of headset used. Using a far off manage in sync
              with the established headset permits the consumer to have
              interaction with 3D objects in space, inside the experience—either
              for VR video games or digital interfaces and apps. What Is
              Augmented Reality (AR)? Just as the identify suggests, Augmented
              Reality, or AR, provides to our appreciation of the world by means
              of overlapping computer-generated graphics, images, or a set of
              interactive data. How Does AR Work? As of today, AR solely
              requires a smartphone with a digital camera and an AR app. Two key
              factors that make it work are the digital camera capability to
              seize the environment round you as you go and the software program
              that calculates and initiatives some computer-generated visuals or
              content. One terrific instance of this in motion is IKEA’s latest
              AR app that permits everyone to think about how any room or house
              would sense with some of the brand’s furniture. What About Mixed
              Reality (MR)? Mixed actuality is a hybrid of VR and AR and targets
              to provide the great of each world. For instance, whilst it makes
              use of a headset simply like VR, seeing via a translucent viewport
              or glass, it additionally tasks visuals on pinnacle of our
              environment. What makes MR stand out is its quite interactive
              aspect, and the sensible rendering of the projection it provides
              to our surroundings. Instead of relying fully on far flung
              controllers or cellphone screens, we can have interaction with the
              immersive content material the usage of herbal physique and finger
              gestures. 5 approaches to use Augmented Reality in your
              advertising strategy: 1. Let customers attempt earlier than they
              buy Potential clients have continually desired to strive
              merchandise earlier than buying them. Fitting rooms, beauty
              samples, car check drives, and many different associated standards
              testify to the effectiveness of this income strategy. Augmented
              buying experiences are one of the rising traits in the retail
              industry. 2. Augment travelling and assistance: Augmented fact
              provides the achievable for groups to add a digital aspect on
              pinnacle of their bodily places and products. Customers can scan a
              product or object to pull up an AR journey tailor-made both
              towards giving extra statistics about the product or some shape of
              supplemental brand-related experience. 3. Augment branding
              materials Augmented truth can take branding substances like
              enterprise playing cards and brochures to the subsequent stage by
              using including a digital component. Users can scan printed
              substances with their cell units to get entry to a vary of aspects
              giving them greater records and approaches to get in contact with
              the brand. 4. Create a buzz round the brand Augmented truth can
              additionally be used as section of an oblique income and
              advertising strategy. While the preceding AR purposes targeted on
              direct approaches for facilitating sales, AR can additionally be
              used to decorate the repute of the company itself.
